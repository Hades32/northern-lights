NORTHER LIGHTS
==============

A little tool that auto-magically ensures your IKEA Tradfri lamps
always use a (white spectrum) color that matches the sun.

It currently works only if

* you live in Ulm, Germany (or at least somewhere near)
* you only have white-spectrum lights (not sure what happens otherwise)
